Lie down and rest awhile mother,

watch the suns rise and set, as

spring winds cover you in a blanket of a

thousand blossoms

Lying in the arms of Akatawara

Let the wild Autumn winds surround you

in the love that surrounds our

children playing and dancing in your

garden of roses

Lying in the arms of Akatawara

Let your garden be our garden,

in our time, or our children's time

You are forever in our thoughts.

and never alone

Lying in the arms of Akatawara
