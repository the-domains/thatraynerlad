# 

If you only met her every now and then,

That's all it took, you were in love with Lorna

She took your breath away, and gave it back

breathing life into you, like never before

She was a dark beautiful elegant woman, with

a spunky teenage girl deep inside 

She was too alive to be gone -- she's still here 

in the wind whistling around the peninsula

She is the waves lapping up Little Manly

embracing me as I walk along our beach 

Lorna -- I'm glad I met her now and then

briefly -- that's all I needed, that was enough
