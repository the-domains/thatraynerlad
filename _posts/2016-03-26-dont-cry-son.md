Don't cry son, please don't grieve.

You know I'm here; I'd never leave.

For, I'm in the spirit of your child,

playing their games, laughing, running wild.

That's how it is, you know this is true,

all those years I said 'you've got grandpa in you'!

So be happy; play with your child; think of me.

I'll be building that castle or climbing that tree.

I'll have the sun on my face, wind through my hair,

so don't cry, don't grieve -- for I'll be there.
