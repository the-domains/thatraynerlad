Is it really over now,

now that we have a headstone

A place to visit you, to see you cast

your shadow once more

I don't want it to be over,

What is over anyway, how can

we be over you

in life, in death

From life, to death, from bed

A Casket to fuel the funeral fire.

Ashes to fill the ground we

Walk on when we visit you

Saying hello, thinking what might

have been; what should have been

thanking, thinking, feeling ok

about wonderful times

More times, without you

Visiting you while I can

Feeling that you're here

That it isn't really over now
