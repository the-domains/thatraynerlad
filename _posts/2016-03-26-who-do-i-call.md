Who shall I ring, who do I call,

who'll comfort me, when I fall

In the past you were there

with your love, with your care

Just a few minutes, that's all I'd need

You'd stop the ache, stop the bleed

Who shall I call, who do I phone?

Now that you've left, now I'm alone

Your numbers by your name,

It's not connected -- not the same

But I won't ring, I won't call

For I'll be stronger when I fall
